'''
Input Layer: The input layer receives sensory inputs from the game environment, such as visual and auditory cues, and processes this information to create a representation of the game world and its elements.

Perception Layer: The perception layer further processes the sensory inputs and extracts relevant features from the game environment, such as the location and movement of enemies or the presence of power-ups. This layer may include convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or other feature extraction techniques.

Attention Layer: The attention layer selectively filters out irrelevant or distracting stimuli and focuses on relevant cues within the game environment. This layer may include attention mechanisms or  other methods for selective attention.

Memory Layer: The memory layer stores information about the game world and its rules, such as the location of enemies or the effects of certain power-ups, and uses this information to make decisions and take actions. This layer may include recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or other methods for sequential processing.

Decision-making Layer: The decision-making layer evaluates the available options and selects the most appropriate action based on the current game state and the player's goals. This layer may include   deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques or other methods for decision-making.

Motor Control Layer: The motor control layer sends signals to the muscles and coordinates their movements to execute the selected action withinthe game. This layer may include motor control algorithms or other methods for motor planning and execution.

Feedback Layer: The feedback layer receives feedback from the game environment, such as the results of the player's actions or the consequences of the game state, and uses this information to update its perception, attention, memory, decision-making, and motor control processes. This layer may include backpropagation or other methods for feedback-based learning.

Output Layer: The output layer generates the actions to be taken by the player within the game environment, such as moving the character, firing a weapon, or using a power-up.
